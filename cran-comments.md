I have revised the package in response to the feedback on the previous submission:
- All functions now have their return value documented.
- The long-form description of the package no longer starts with "This package" or similar.

## Test environment
* ubuntu 20.04, devel and release
* windows, release
* macOS, release

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.
